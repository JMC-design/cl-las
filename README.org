* cl-las

This Common Lisp library gives a basic access to the /de facto/
standard LAS files as defined here:

http://www.asprs.org/Committee-General/LASer-LAS-File-Format-Exchange-Activities.html

For simple usage, the UI is straightforward. You open a LAS file with
the =with-las= macro and then you can access its points with the
=read-point-at= function. A point is an object and you have accessors
to get its slots' values.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(las:with-las (las "~/tmp/foo.las")
  (loop for i below (las:las-number-of-points las)
        collect (las:x (las:read-point-at i las :scale-p t))))
#+END_SRC
